        <h1>The 5 Dermatologist Mistakes That Make Your "Strawberry Skin" Worse</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">And the one clinical breakthrough that's finally giving patients the smooth skin they've been desperately seeking</p>

        <section class="story-section">
            <h2>The Patient Who Changed Everything</h2>
            <p>Rebecca walked into my clinic on a Tuesday morning, arms crossed tightly over her chest despite the summer heat. She'd been to four dermatologists before me, each promising to fix her keratosis pilaris—what she called her "strawberry arms."</p>
            
            <p>Her story was heartbreakingly familiar. Aggressive scrubs that left her skin raw and bleeding. Steroid creams that worked for weeks, then stopped. Expensive laser treatments that made the bumps angry and red. Each failed treatment had chipped away at her confidence until she refused to wear anything that didn't cover her arms completely.</p>
            
            <p class="quote">"I just want normal skin," she whispered, finally uncrossing her arms to show me the damage. "Why is that so impossible?"</p>
            
            <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0629/0613/8684/files/0c5acd8c-d4f3-40b0-a6f4-b5dce977e9aa_medium_41e70858-8420-4071-92f6-5030f552f3f3.png?v=1756430373" alt="Woman covering her arms showing frustration with strawberry skin">
            <p class="image-caption">The frustration and embarrassment were visible in every bump</p>
            
            <p>That question haunted me for months. Why were we, as dermatologists, failing so many patients with something as "simple" as keratosis pilaris?</p>
        </section>

        <section class="story-section">
            <h2>The Investigation That Shook My Profession</h2>
            <p>I spent the next six months reviewing case files, interviewing colleagues, and studying the latest research on keratosis pilaris pathophysiology. What I found was disturbing.</p>
            
            <p>We weren't treating keratosis pilaris—we were treating our assumptions about it. For decades, the dermatology community had approached KP as a simple "too much keratin" problem. Scrub it off. Burn it off. Medicate it away.</p>
            
            <p>But new research revealed KP is actually a complex interplay of abnormal skin cell turnover, compromised barrier function, and chronic low-grade inflammation. The treatments we'd been prescribing weren't just ineffective—they were making the underlying problem worse.</p>
            
            <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0629/0613/8684/files/c62af87d-8126-4f7c-b848-9d5fb83ee9f6_medium_c1e70d22-5fde-462d-b495-aedfff8f3e87.png?v=1756430340" alt="Rebecca showing smooth skin results">
            <p class="image-caption">"I finally have the smooth skin I thought was impossible" - Rebecca</p>
            
            <p>This breakthrough moment changed everything. The proof was undeniable - by addressing the root cause instead of attacking symptoms, we achieved results that traditional treatments couldn't deliver.</p>

                <h3><span class="mistake-number">1</span><span class="mistake-title">The "Scrub Harder" Fallacy</span></h3>
                <p>Aggressive scrubbing creates microscopic tears, triggering inflammation that makes your body produce MORE keratin as protection. We were literally making the problem worse.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake-item">
                <h3><span class="mistake-number">2</span><span class="mistake-title">The Steroid Band-Aid Approach</span></h3>
                <p>Steroids reduce inflammation quickly but thin the skin and create dependency. When patients stopped, KP returned worse because we never fixed the root cause.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake-item">
                <h3><span class="mistake-number">3</span><span class="mistake-title">Ignoring the Barrier Breakdown</span></h3>
                <p>We attacked keratin plugs while ignoring skin barrier repair. Without fixing the barrier, we were emptying a bathtub with the faucet still running.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake-item">
                <h3><span class="mistake-number">4</span><span class="mistake-title">The Single-Agent Mistake</span></h3>
                <p>High-dose single acids either caused irritation or were too weak to penetrate effectively. KP needs multiple ingredients working together.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="mistake-item">
                <h3><span class="mistake-number">5</span><span class="mistake-title">Treating Symptoms, Missing the System</span></h3>
                <p>We attacked bumpy skin instead of asking why skin cells don't shed properly. KP is a cellular communication problem, not just a keratin problem.</p>

            <p>Every lotion, scrub, and prescription failed because they skipped the 3 ingredients science says actually work: glycolic acid, lactic acid, and salicylic acid. These acids dissolve keratin buildup, unclog follicles, and smooth your skin fast. Strawberry is built entirely on this research, which is why it works when everything else doesn't.</p>

            <h2>The Breakthrough That Changes Everything</h2>
            <p>Working with a team of biochemists and frustrated by my own patients' failures, I developed what we now call the "Barrier-First Protocol"</p>
            
            <p>Instead of attacking the skin, we support it. Instead of one harsh ingredient, we use five gentle ones that work together. Instead of treating symptoms, we restore the skin's natural ability to self-regulate.</p>

                <div class="timeline-description">At her one-week follow-up, Rebecca's transformation was remarkable. Her arms were smooth to the touch, the strawberry appearance had cleared, and most importantly, she was wearing a sleeveless dress. "I feel normal again," she said with tears in her eyes.</div>
